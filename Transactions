Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read
nonrepeatable read or read skew
Snapshot isolation is the most common solution to this problem. The idea is that each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database.

Implementing snapshot isolation
To implement snapshot isolation, databases use a generalization of the mechanism we saw for preventing dirty reads.
The database must potentially keep several different committed versions of an object, 
because various in-progress trans‚Äê actions may need to see the state of the database at different points in time. 
Because it maintains several versions of an object side by side, this technique is known as multi- version concurrency control (MVCC)
